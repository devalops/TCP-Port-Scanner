### TCP Port Scanner

![Port](icon.png)

I made a quick & efficient TCP port scanner that allows you to scan for open ports on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. It uses multi-threading for improved performance, and the scanner can quickly identify open ports on the specified machine. It is a helpful tool to discover open ports that should not be running.

Therefore, this script helps you to discover suspicious ports, which might suggest an undiscovered threat.

### Usage:

1. Specify the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)
2. Enter the minimum port number for your scan range
3. Enter the maximum port number for your scan range
4. Specify the target IP
